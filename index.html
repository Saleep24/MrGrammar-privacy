MrGrammar is a Chrome extension that provides real-time grammar and spelling corrections directly within your browser.

1. Data Collection and Usage
MrGrammar does not collect or store any personally identifiable information. When you use the extension, the selected text may be sent securely to a third-party language processing API (e.g. OpenAI) to provide grammar suggestions. This data is not stored, linked to your identity, or reused for any other purpose.

2. Third-Party Services
We use trusted third-party APIs strictly to fulfill the extensionâ€™s grammar-checking functionality. These services are contractually prohibited from storing or using data beyond what's necessary for the task.

3. No User Tracking
MrGrammar does not track your browsing activity, keystrokes, or interactions. We do not use cookies, analytics, or any form of user behavior tracking.

4. Permissions
The extension uses browser permissions only to operate on supported sites (e.g., Gmail, LinkedIn, Slack) and to provide grammar suggestions inline. No permission is used to collect or transmit personal data.

5. Data Security
All communication with third-party APIs is encrypted. We take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is processed securely and in compliance with relevant regulations.

6. Changes
We may update this policy as needed. If changes are significant, we will provide a clear notice within the extension or Web Store listing.

7. Contact
